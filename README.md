# Coders Profiles (CP)

## Motivation

The primary idea is to practice, just that, by practicing we're going to solidify our knowledge,
it doesn't matter what you do, nothing is always 100% fine, there are many things to improve, so
I want to approch this project with the idea of getting experience in creating software, software
we are proud of! Yes I know, we want to be the best ones, I also know there are times when we feel
destroyed because we are not able achieve our goals.

## The idea

For this project I'm thinking about a website where we have information about us **"Coders profiles"**,
our basic information:

- name
- country
- description about us
- profile picture
- skills
- things we are learning
- links to our social media profiles (Github, Instagram, Twitter, etc)
