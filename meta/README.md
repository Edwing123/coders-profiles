Technical information about the project.

## How is this organized?

---

The idea is that every member of the group (actually, the ones that wish to do so) gets its own page.

Examples

```
example.com/coders/edwin-garcia
example.com/coders/edgar-moreno
example.com/coders/john-doe
```

## What kind of website?

I want things to be simple, so we're going to build a static website, but the process of building the
static pages will be kind of dynamic, we will use an HTML template engine that helps us in creating the HTML
very quicky.

## Technology stack (still in progress)

- ejs - HTML template engine
- SASS - CSS preprocessor
- Typescript - Typed superset of Javascript
- Node - for building the templates using the template engine compiler (ejs)
