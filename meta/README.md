# Coders Profiles (CP)

## Motivation
The primary idea is to practice, just that, by practicing we're going to solidify our knowledge,
it doesn't matter what you do, nothing is always 100% fine, there are many things to improve, so
I want to approch this project with the idea of getting experience in creating software, software
we are proud of! Yes I know, we want to be the best ones, I also know there are times when we feel
destroyed because we are not able achieve our goals.

## The idea
For this project I'm thinking about a website where we have information about us **"Coders profiles"**,
our basic information:

+ name
+ country
+ description about us
+ profile picture
+ skills
+ things we are learning
+ links to our social media profiles (Github, Instagram, Twitter, etc)

## How is this organized?
---
The idea is that every member of the group (actually, the ones that wish to do so) gets its own page.

Examples
```
example.com/coders/edwin-garcia
example.com/coders/edgar-moreno
example.com/coders/john-doe
```

## What kind of website?
I want things to be simple, so we're going to build a static website, but the process of building the
static pages will be kind of dynamic, we will use an HTML template engine that helps us in creating the HTML
very quicky.

## Technology stack (still in progress)
+ ejs - HTML template engine
+ SASS - CSS preprocessor
+ Typescript - Typed superset of Javascript
+ Node - for building the templates using the template engine compiler (ejs)
